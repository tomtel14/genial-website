      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Genial have been developing websites for local businesses and non-profit organisations since 1998.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In more recent years we have moved our main focus to running an online store in partnership with
      one of our clients while still updating a small number of websites for some of our long established
customers.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Over the years our emphasis has been on developing websites with high quality images which are procured through our own photography work and digital editing. As a result, we are now in the process of diversifying into photography.
