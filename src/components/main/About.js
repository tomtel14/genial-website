      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Genial have been developing websites for local businesses and non-profit organisations since 1998.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In more recent years we have moved our main focus to running an online store in partnership with
      one of our clients while still updating a small number of websites for some of our long established
customers.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Over the years our emphasis has been to develop websites with high quality images and carried out
      all our own photography work. So much so, that we have decided to diverse into photography.
