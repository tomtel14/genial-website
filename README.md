# Genial Website

* Completed re-designed this website from scratch. Built and deployed using React.

* Built using function components. Nav component conditionally rendered in mobile mode (dependant on state).

* useState and useEffect hooks employed to deal with interactivity and listeners.

* Data for array of clients stored locally so they can be easily updated and mapped into relevant component.

* This project gave me a chance to produce a neat and tidy design without having to worry about lots of content. Looks and works slightly different on mobile to make it easier for the user to navigate.
